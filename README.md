# generator-nextjs-orm-app
A yeoman generator to scaffold a fully functioning Nextjs app with drizzle orm.

This is my first attempt at a serious yeoman generator.
I based the Next js code from the "Max Programming" Youtube channel which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxuPB-04Tdw "Max Programming")

The instructions for installing Yeoman can be found [here](https://yeoman.io/learning/) but basically it's as simple as 
`npm install -g yo`

You *should* end up with a simple Next JS app that uses drizzle as the intermediary between the front end and the server, storing the data in a small Sqlite database.
